This is the beginnings of a project I am using as my foray into the internet of things.  Currently this project consists of some simple modifications I've done to the I-Racer app( https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11162 ), an android powered Bluetooth RC car.  The modifications at this stage are simply to add the ability, via the AsyncTask class, to control the phone, and therefore the car, remotely.  All that is send to the phone is the byte code that then gets send, via Bluetooth, to the I-Racer.  What I hope to implement next is the ability to see what the phone/car sees via a video stream, however, it is much more difficult at least to send it out onto the internet.  I guess my first step is to send it via LAN.  This should be fairly easy as there are already existing apps (free/open source) that can do this.  I've tried to add comments although probably more could be detailed.  Hope you find it useful!  This is mainly code from the I-Racer app and I want to thank Arexx ( http://www.arexx.com.cn/ )for giving me the source.
