I found a cheap and readably hackable RC car that is controlled by the Bluetooth of an Android phone on sparkfun.com ( https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11162 ).  This project is my somewhat ongoing modifications of this simple car to convert it from just a locally controlled car to something that can be controlled from anywhere and is eventually somewhat autonomous. The modifications at this stage are to add the ability, via the AsyncTask class, to control the phone, and therefore the car, remotely.  All that is send to the phone is the byte code that then gets send, via Bluetooth, to the I-Racer.  What I hope to implement next is the ability to see what the phone/car sees via a video stream, however, it is much more difficult at least to send it out onto the internet.  I guess my first step is to send it via LAN.  This should be fairly easy as there are already existing apps (free/open source) that can do this.  One can get a copy of the code from github at https://github.com/TheOtherRealm/car.  I've tried to add comments to the source code, although probably more could be added.  Hope you find it useful!
